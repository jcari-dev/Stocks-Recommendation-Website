## FAQ

#### Should I use this application as financial advice?

No. I am not a financial expert/advisor.

#### How are stocks recommendations for short-term traders determined?

The way that those stocks are selected is with a combination of the highest standard deviation (percent and flat) and using polynomial equations to determine the trend in the time series. 

#### How are stocks recommendations for long-term traders determined?

The stocks that have performed the best (meaning, the ones that have generated the highest profit by difference over time) over a 5+ year period are the ones selected.
